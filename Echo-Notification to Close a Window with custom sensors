# Home Assistant Automation Blueprint
#
# Sends three notifications to an Amazon Echo device to close a window or door after opening it, 
# if the humidity reading (indoor) and temperature reading (outdoor) of the given sensors are below a certain level. 
# or this blueprint you need a a working Alexa Media Player Integration, and a humidity sensor that updates its data in short intervalls.
# Most likely it needs a wired power connection for this. A working configuration is the SONOFF TH Sensor Si7021 connected to a Sonoff TH10.
